# IPS Application Boilerplate

#### For IPS 4.4x developers a simple boilerplate for Application building. A standard Application directory setup with a minimal set of files including routers, controllers , templates and dev folder for a starting base. Includes default index page for starters.

## Features

- Standard file and directory structure for IPS 4.4 Application development
- Generic "dashboard" modules [Front/Admin] for starters
- Application.php includes standard permissions, icon and FrontNavigation
- Extensions: FrontNavigation
- Modules Front: Main Controller
- Modules Admin: Overview and Settings Controllers (Enable applications, group permissions, custom appplication name)
- Data JSON: acpmenu, acpsearch, extensions, furl, modules, settings [application, hooks, widgets, schema, themesettings, tasks and version not provided but generated automatically]
- dev folder: lang and html starter files. [css, js, resources, or email not provided]

## Usage and Install

- First create a new application in IPS developer Mode and fill in the information. Application directory will be your application name, make note of it for below.
- Enter the Developer center for your application
  - Create your version typically 1.0.0 (10000)
  - Create "dashboard" in Modules-Admin (You can choose another name for this directory but make sure to update the boilerplate directory name as well as file class names)
  - Create "dashboard" in Modules-Front (You can choose another name for this directory but make sure to update the boilerplate directory name as well as file class names)

- A small amount of editing on your part will get you up and running in a couple minutes. Rename all instances of boilerplate/Boilerplate [case sensitive!!!] in files and directory names to match your aplications name. I suggest using a text app like [TextCrawler](https://www.digitalvolcano.co.uk/textcrawler.html) to do it in a second or your favorite text editor to find and replace [Match Case please!!!].
- Files
  - \Application.php [6 instances]
  - \modules\front\dashboard\main.php [7 instances]
  - \modules\admin\dashboard\overview.php [6 instances]
  - \modules\admin\dashboard\settings.php [22 instances]
  - \extensions\core\FrontNavigation\Boilerplate.php [10 instances plus file name]
  - \dev\lang.php [23 instances]

- Upload the contents of the src directory to your new app directory

- To test, make it the default application and add a menu item for your application
